Usage of quick_viewer.html
    quick_viewer.html is a lightweight image viewing system written in HTML and JavaScript. It allows users to group and display image files based on user-specified parameters, assuming a consistent file naming and folder structure.

Requirements
    A local or remote web server is required to run quick_viewer.html.
    Works well with tools like Visual Studio Code Remote or any environment that supports serving files over HTTP.

Setup Instructions
    Place quick_viewer.html at the top-level directory containing your image files.
    Ensure that your image files follow a regular naming pattern and a consistent folder hierarchy (e.g., type/model/image_name.png).

Launch a simple web server from the same directory:
    python -m http.server 8000

Open the following URL in your browser: http://localhost:8000/

Notes
    Works both locally and on remote servers (with port forwarding or web server setup).
    Make sure the directory structure and naming are compatible with how quick_viewer.html parses and displays image groups.
